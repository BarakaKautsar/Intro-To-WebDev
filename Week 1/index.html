      This article was an interesting but also particularly challenging read for
      me. It took me 3 attempts to read it in it’s whole entirety because my
      undiagnosed ADHD brain kept needing to re-read the paragraphs as I realize
      I’m reading yet not understanding a single word this man is writing.

      What I found most astonishing was the accuracy in his predictions
      regarding the future of technology and information. It’s a reminder of how
      far we’ve come and how our relationship with knowledge and information has
      transformed dramatically.

      His description of the ‘Memex’ machine was also particularly interesting
      in how he described an apparatus that would be able to store and
      systematically search a repository of books and articles. In a way, he was
      describing what we now recognize as the internet and it’s many tools like
      a search engine and hyper links. The terminologies he chose also serves as
      a reminder of the time this article was written in. At the time, the
      digital monitor has yet to be invented so he kept using the word
      ‘projected’ where we would typically use ‘displayed’ because he can only
      imagine visual information to be stored in a film like material.

      Ultimately this article reminds me to not take the technologies that we
      have today for granted. It’s almost unfathomable for many of us to imagine
      a world predating the invention of many devices we use daily in our lives
      such as our phones, computers, digital cameras, and of course the
      internet. It’s a great reminder of how powerful and complex these devices
      are and the countless amounts of research and development efforts made to
      engineer and mass-produce these technologies.
