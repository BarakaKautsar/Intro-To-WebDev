        in his book McLuhan talks about how all forms of communication in which
        information is conveyed, even language and letters, has the power to
        influence human preception. regardless of the content of the information
        itself.

        I think it is funny how with the advent of computing and the internet,
        essentially all forms of information from letters and numbers to images
        and videos are further encoded into the digital format. binary. a series
        of 1s and 0s.
