      <h2>What is Web 2.0?</h2>
      <p>
        Web 2.0 refers to the second generation of the World Wide Web,
        characterized by the shift from static web pages to dynamic and
        interactive user experiences. This phase marked a transition from the
        early days of the internet (Web 1.0) to a more collaborative and
        participatory online environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Web 2.0 represents a paradigm shift from the early days of the internet,
        focusing on user engagement, collaboration, and the development of a
        more interactive and interconnected online space. It has had a profound
        impact on the way people communicate, share information, and conduct
        business on the web.

            <h2>The Long Tail</h2>
            <p>
              Small sites represents a large volume of the web therefore making
              services that reaches out to the entire far edges of the web
              instead of only focusing on the larger 'head' is important.

            <h2>Data is the Next Intel Inside</h2>
            <p>
              With increasing prevalence of data-driven applications, the need
              for new and more unique data is increasing. Therefore: For
              competitive advantage, seek to own a unique, hard-to-recreate
              source of data.

            <h2>Users Add Value</h2>
            <p>
              The competitive edge in internet applications lies in the degree
              to which users contribute their own data alongside the information
              provided by the application itself.

          <li class="slide">
            <h2>Network Effects by Default</h2>
            <p>
              Applications needs to establish default settings that inclusively
              gather user data incidentally during their use of the application.
              In other words, encourage data aggregation by default to capture
              valuable information from a broader user base, considering that
              only a minority will proactively contribute.

            <h2>Some Rights Reserved</h2>
            <p>
              Safeguarding intellectual property through protection measures can
              hinder the ability to reuse and experiment with ideas.
              Consequently, in situations where advantages arise from widespread
              acceptance rather than private restrictions, efforts should be
              made to minimize barriers to adoption.

            <h2>The Perpetual Beta</h2>
            <p>
              With the internet, the limitations of the development cycle has
              changed. Updates to an application no longer has to be packaged up
              into monolithic releases and instead can be released continuously
              while simultaneously doing user testing.

            <h2>Cooperate, Don't Control</h2>
            <p>
              Web 2.0 Applications are constructed by integrating various
              cooperating data services. To support the collaborative and
              flexible nature of these applications, theres a need to endorse
              lightweight programming models that enable the development of
              loosely-coupled systems. Essentially, an approach that fosters
              collaboration, interoperability, and flexibility in building and
              utilizing web applications.

            <p>
              The internet can be accessed from all kinds of devices, No just a
              PC. Applications need to be able to work with a dynamic set of
              screen sizes, input modes, and device capabilities.

      <h2>What does this mean for user privacy and surveillance?</h2>
      <p>
        On the positive side, many platforms offer users greater control over
        their privacy settings, allowing them to determine who sees their
        content and manage personal information. Transparency measures, such as
        disclosing data practices in privacy policies, aim to inform users about
        how their data is handled. Enhanced security measures, like encryption
        and secure login procedures, contribute to protecting user data.
        However, negative aspects include the extensive data collection for
        targeted advertising, potential privacy infringements from government
        surveillance, and the risk of data breaches. Users' willingness to share
        personal information on social media raises concerns about invasive
        profiling, while a lack of user awareness about the implications of
        their online activities remains a challenge. Mitigation strategies
        involve users leveraging privacy settings, educational initiatives to
        enhance user awareness, regulatory measures to enforce privacy laws, and
        ongoing development of privacy-enhancing technologies. Achieving a
        balance between the benefits of interconnected online experiences and
        safeguarding user privacy is an ongoing challenge that requires
        collaboration between users, platforms, and regulatory bodies.

      <h2>Reflection</h2>
      <p>
        As a gen-z, I feel like web 2.0 and many of it’s most popular sites like
        google, wikipedia, facebook is the version of the internet that I am
        most familiar with since it is the version that we basically grew up in.
        In fact for an embarrassingly long time, I initially thought that google
        and “the internet” are interchangeable terms that points to the same
        thing. And so, it was really interesting to see how the internet
        operates before these sites existed and how the development of web 2.0
        is sort of like a natural progression towards decentralization of the
        internet.
