      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>
        “Long Live The Web” is an article by Tim Berners-Lee who is the inventor
        of the world wide web, the HTML mark up language, the URL system, and
        HTTP, so yeah pretty big deal. In this article, Berners-Lee highlights
        the challenges the web faces in regards to its role as the catalyst for
        innovation and its the right for us the general public to use and access
        it. This article is a call to action, reminding us that the web isn’t
        some natural phenomenon we have no control over, instead it is the
        embodiment of the potential for collaboration without borders.
      </p>
      <h2>Web as a Democratic Platform</h2>
      <p>
        “The Web is now more critical to free speech than any other medium.” In
        many ways the Web is the realization of the saying “Power to the
        People”. The web is largely driven by its users; it is us who hold the
        power over what gets seen, what gets shared, what gets deleted. While I
        do believe that regulations and standards for the internet need to be
        put in place and upheld in order to maintain internet safety, the
        openness and freedom that comes with the internet needs to be protected
        as well.
      </p>
      <h2>Universality & Open Standards</h2>
      <p>
        This article highlights 2 major principles that allowed the Web to
        become what it is today; universality and open standards. Universality
        means that everyone needs to be able to gain access to the web no matter
        the hardware that they use, the language that they speak, the country
        that they live in, even the disability they might have. Open standards
        mean that the standards required to add to the web are readily available
        and free to use for developers and users.
      </p>
      <p>
        These 2 principles are key to making sure that the conversations and
        sharing of information that happens every day on the web doesn’t exclude
        anyone. This, in turn, can help drive innovation forward because the
        resources available to anyone at any given time are practically
        boundless.

        <div>
          <h2>Capitalism - the root of all evil</h2>
          <p>
            However, the two principles mentioned above are under attack by
            companies to make more money. A lot of companies are collecting and
            snooping data from its users without their knowledge and consent.
            And some ISPs are limiting bandwidth when their users try to connect
            to a webpage that isn’t affiliated with them. Some governments are
            also infringing upon their citizen’s right for privacy and access to
            the internet. With the web gaining more and more influence over
            every aspect of our lives, any attempt to gain too much power in the
            internet should be met with substantial backlash from us, the users.

      <h2>The Future</h2>
      <p>
        With how fast the internet is growing, changing, and evolving, it is
        exciting yet also terrifying to think about what it may become in the
        future. But one thing for sure is that the principles that make the
        internet open need to be respected and built upon to make sure it
        remains neutral and for the public. Some trends for the future of the
        web include open data, social machines, web science, and free bandwidth.
