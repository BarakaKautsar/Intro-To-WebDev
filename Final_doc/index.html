        This website was developed as a final project for the NYU IDM Intro to
        Web Development course. This website is meant to be used as a catalog
        for the things I’m going to sell because I’m moving back to Indonesia in
        January of 2024. Here, the user can view all the things I’m selling
        including the photos, descriptions, and price. The user can use the cart
        functionality to order multiple items at once after signing up to the
        website using their email address. However, the website does not
        currently handle transactions and therefore the user is directed to
        contact me directly, either through email; text; or social media, in
        order to make a purchase.

      <h2>Tools & Resources:</h2>
      <p>
        To build the backend of this project I used Firebase. Which is a backend
        as a service (BaaS) product by google. With firebase, I was able to
        handle authentication in order to sign up and sign in and store the data
        for my user and products using firestore which is a cloud NoSQL database
        service built into firebase. I used the series of videos by
        <a
          href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zdvmgGsww0&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9jERUGvbudErNCeSZHWUVlb"
          >Net Ninja</a
        >
        on youtube on getting started with Firebase 9 in order to help me
        develop the backend for my website.
      </p>
      <p>
        To deploy my website I used Vercel which is a cloud platform that
        simplifies the deployment and hosting of web applications. Vercel also
        includes continuous deployment from a git repository so every time I do
        a git push, Vercel will automatically deploy the newest version of my
        website. I was able to deploy this thanks to the help of my very good
        friend Bach Le.

        <h2>Website Pages:</h2>
        <h3>Main Page:</h3>
        <p>
          The main page is the first page that the user will see when they visit
          the website. The main page will display the items that are currently
          available for sale. The user can click on the item to see more
          details.

        <h3>Product Modal</h3>
        <p>
          When a user clicks on the product card, a modal will appear displaying
          more information about the product. There are also buttons to add to
          cart and place order. The user doesn't have to sign in in order to
          place and order for a single product. However, if they want to add to
          cart, they will need to sign up first.
        </p>

        <h3>Authentication Pages</h3>
        <p>
          If the user clicks on the account button on the upper right corner of
          the page and the user is not signed in, it will direct them to a page
          where they can sign up or log in. The user will be able to sign up
          using their email and password.

        <h3>User Info page</h3>
        <p>
          If the user clicks on the account button and they are already signed
          in, they will be directed to the user information page where they can
          see their email address and user ID. Here, the user can also log out
          of their account.

          page, they will be directed to the cart page where they can see the
          items that they have added to their cart. Here, the user can also
          remove items from their cart and place an order. The user will need ot
          log in in order to use this functionality.

        <p>
          In the order page, the user will be able to see the products they want
          to order along with the total price for each item. If the user access
          this page through their cart, all of the items in the cart will be
          included. However if the user access this from the product modal, then
          only that product will be included in this page. The page also
          includes 3 buttons that will redirect the user to their preferred
          method of contacting me to place an order.

          The FAQ page includes some questions that the user may have about the
          site and about me. This page also includes links to contact me if the
